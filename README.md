# Optimization-AI

Note: Code is kept private.

This project implements algorithms to solve optimization problems formulated as linear and integer programming problems. 
Here is a list of them:

1. An algorithm to return a list of all faesible intersection points given a list of linear inequality constraints.
2. An algorithm to return a faesible intersection that minimizes the objective given a list of linear inequality constraints.
3. Branch and bound algorithm to solve integer programming problems. Given a list of linear inequality constraints and a cost vector, this algorithm returns a faesible point with integer values that minimizes the objective.
